Potential Applications
    Collision Alert
    Road Condition Warnings
    Merge assistance
    deceleration Warnings

    internet connectivity

    gps
    toll roads
    cruise control

Internet of Vehicles Network Communication
    Intra-vehicle systems
    vehicle to vehicle (V2V) systems
    vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) systems
    Vehicle to Cloud (V2C) systems
    Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) systems

3 layers - sensors, then networks (5G, Wifi etc) and then Application layer (the real use of the data)

We will go for a low cost practical solution, which will help us solve some problem, and is feasible for implementation. Not very resource intensive solution
